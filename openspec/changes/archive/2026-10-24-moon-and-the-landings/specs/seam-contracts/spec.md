## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: A claim is about one digest by one signer

A claim SHALL be about exactly one digest, SHALL name its kind and the
revision it was made for, and SHALL name the build identity where it
has one (7, 13). A signed envelope SHALL have a digest of its own by
which a promotion names its predecessor (105, 120). An envelope holding
a claim of tailrace's form SHALL hold exactly one claim and the
signature of exactly one signer, and one holding any other number of
signatures SHALL be read as no claim of tailrace's form (7). An
envelope carried from another party SHALL hold every signature it was
made with, each with its signer and its key id as made, and the payload
and its type byte for byte (12, C.5).

#### Scenario: A claim with no build identity

- **WHEN** a claim is made with a revision and no build identity
- **THEN** it is a claim, and reading it back answers no build identity rather than an empty one

#### Scenario: An envelope's digest

- **WHEN** the same signed envelope is held in two places
- **THEN** both answer the same envelope digest

#### Scenario: A claim carried inside another

- **WHEN** a claim holds another party's signed envelope as found
- **THEN** reading the claim back answers that envelope byte for byte as it was made (12)

#### Scenario: Another party's envelope with two signatures

- **WHEN** a claim carries an envelope signed twice, each signature with its own key id
- **THEN** reading the claim back answers both signatures with their key ids, in the order made

#### Scenario: Tailrace's form with two signatures

- **WHEN** an envelope holding a claim of tailrace's form carries two signatures
- **THEN** it is read as no claim of tailrace's form

### Requirement: The landing's contract

The landing SHALL answer landed with whether a branch has landed a
revision (77), and verdicts-of with every verdict recorded for a
revision, each naming its check, its build identity, its outcome and
its signer, with its signed envelope as the landing recorded it, and
where the landing found it, in the landing's own words (12, 78).

#### Scenario: A revision with no verdicts

- **WHEN** verdicts-of is asked for a revision the landing recorded no verdict for
- **THEN** it answers an empty set of verdicts, which is not absent and not unreadable

#### Scenario: Where a verdict was found

- **WHEN** verdicts-of answers a verdict
- **THEN** the verdict says where the landing found it
